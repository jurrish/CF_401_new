##Today I am creating a TCP chat server based on Event-Emitters in NodeJS

##So, when an event occurs, a function is triggered and information is sent across the wire.

##The listener is attached to an event, and a function is registered to an event and onEvent, the function is triggered.

#TCP Socket: Virtual plug-in point via TCP/IP that allows request flow
